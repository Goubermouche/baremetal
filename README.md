## baremetal
- Basic assembler which (currently) supports most x64 instructions, including the AVX and AVX-512 extensions. Currently the project functions as a simple instruction translator, and doesn't provide any support for more 'complex' concepts. such as labels, hence it's not ready for actual use.
## Planned
- Labels, data segments, etc.
- CI
- Better broadcast support
- Memory operands with special register bases/indices.
